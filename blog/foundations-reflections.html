				 <h2>	WHAT ARE THREE NEW THINGS THAT YOU HAVE LEARNT ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR EGO DUE TO THE CORE LEARNING? </h2>
				 <i>I learned about the importance of growht mindset and how essential positivity and the right mindset can be when it comes to acheiving your goals, I've also learned how important having a knowledge of EQ and the feelings of others can improve your working enviroment and productivity as a team</i>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <h2>WHAT ARE THE ROLE OF VALUES, EMPATHY, AND SELF-AWARENESS IN LEARNING PROGRAMMING?</h2>
				 <br> <i>Due to the group orientated nature of the upcming bootcamp work it is vital to be empathetic towards your fellow students and to be mindful and respectful of their learning journey. I believe everyones opinion and path of thinking holds value despite the fact that it may differ your own, it doesnt seem anyone is right or wrong while we learn together.</i>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
				 <h2>WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU MOST ABOUT THE CORE LEARNING?</h2>
				 <br> <i>I found a lot of it a lot more interesting than I initally thought I would.
				 </i>
				<br>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <h2>WHY DO YOU THINK WE, A PROGRAMMING SCHOOL, ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON CORE LEARNING IN A WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP COURSE?</h2>
				 <br> <i> Because it takes more than just strong coding skills to be able work effectively within a team. Employers also value self-awareness and strong EQ.</i> 
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 <h2>DOES THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT STUDING CORE LEARNING HERE FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF TIME? SHOULD YOU HAVE JUST USED THAT TIME TO PRACTISE PROGRAMMING INSTEAD?</h2>
				 <br>
				 <i> I think I already have a lot of experience working with and managing others in a team, where as I'm definitley a lot weaker in the technical aspects so for me personally I'd probably get more value from programming practise. HOWEVER, that is not me devalueing its importance and I completely understand the need for this kind of study in the programme.</i>  <br>
